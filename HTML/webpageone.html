              It is now possible to use a cheap, lightweight and
              smartphone-powered DNA detector to identify DNA in blood, urine
              and other samples, on the spot.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, testing to identify DNA is usually done in laboratories
              using expensive, specialised equipment. To make this process
              faster and cheaper, Ming Chen at the Army Medical University in
              China and his colleagues developed a portable DNA detector made of
              3D-printed parts that attach to a standard smartphone.
            </p>
            <p>
              The device can detect DNA based on characteristic mutations or
              short genetic sequences.
            </p>
            <p>The device:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>costs less than $10 to make</li>
              <li>weighs just 60 grams</li>
              <li>takes 80 minutes to produce a result</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

              />
            </div>
            <p>
              The detector is heated by the smartphone. Samples can be loaded
              into the detector and mixed with pre-filled chemicals that light
              up or change colour if there is any DNA that matches. The signals
              are detected through a lens and a light box and the smartphone
              displays the result.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tests showed that the device can detect genetic conditions like

              in blood and it also identified people with a gene that makes them
              more susceptible to alcohol intoxication from swab samples taken
              from their inner cheeks.

              in urine, milk and river water. It also identified a bacterium
              that attacks kiwi fruit plants in ground-up samples of the plant’s
              leaves.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Overall, the accuracy of the device was about 97 per cent when
              compared with standard laboratory methods. The researchers say the
              device could potentially be modified to identify RNA as well,
              which would be useful for detecting RNA viruses like
              the covid-19 virus responsible for the coronavirus pandemic.

            <p>
              Jacqueline Savard at Deakin University in Australia says the
              technology has the potential to cause unintended consequences if
              used outside normal clinical settings, because people wouldn’t
              have access to support and guidance if they test positive for an
              illness.
