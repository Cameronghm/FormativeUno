# Room 3's Comments

## Interest of Content (Excellent)
The index page has a nice theme, and a good layout. However, it is a very long list of tweets. Although useful, perhaps fewer should be shown at once, rather than a list going back to 8 June. There are some very interesting topics listed with brief descriptions.

The DNA page is well constructed with some very useful information on DNA detection and analysis. It is easy to read and divided into distinct sections. It contains links to relevant information for extra reading.

Machine Learning Uses contains lots of information, finished with a nice conclusion. It has links with further reading on the material listed. It also links very well to the next page, describing why machine learning is a game changer.

The page detailing why machine learning is a game changer is useful, and easy to understand for someone who has never done any machine learning. It has a simple layout and quickly describes the  content.

## Consistency and Quality of Visual Presentation (Excellent)
The visual presentation is consistent, however some images are missing due to dead links. One page, the page on DNA, doesn't have any images, however, whereas the others do. The same font is used on all pages, and the same layout, with the dividing lines for sections.

The 'about-me' sections are in the same place for all, however they are quite different. One contains an image of the author, and they all use different icons.

## Quality of Written Communication (Very Good)
There are some grammatical mistakes, such as missing capitalisation and a paragraph that is one sentence, on the page for machine learning being a gamechanger. Everything is clear, however, and the written communication is succinct.

## Validity of HTML (Sound)
All pages flag as having warnings/errors for HTML5 validation (w3 validator). Some links go to the wrong pages, as well, and there are two index pages (one in root and one in HTML). Two images on DNA have invalid paths (the images exist, however in another path).

## Evidence of Collaboration

### Author info not being written by the author of a page (Perfect)
Author information, using git blame, was not done by the author of the page itself. It does show that Cameron did a lot of the commits and modifications.

### Balanced Contribution from Members (Acceptable)
Guy and Cameron each have 1206 and 1167 additions respectively, and 774 and 833 removals, respectively. Whereas LadyJaneGrey had 219 and 3, and qalisha has 231 and 1. The number of commits is also disproportionate.

### Not Completed at the Last Minute (Weak)
Overall it was not completed at the last minute, however 19 of 40 commits have been done in the last day, with 9 in the last 5 hours.
